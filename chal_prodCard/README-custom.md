### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
1)The addition of the icon to the button was an unknown application I hadn't considered before
<button class="button"><img alt='img of cart' src="./product-preview/images/icon-cart.svg">Add To Cart</button>
```
```css
2) Learned that can set a child element to a varying value based off their parent element, which made the page more
flexible
.col{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 50%; /* tells this element to be shift 50% of the parent - "content" */
    max-width: 250px;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I struggled with areas of spacing and orientating flexbox so in the future I'd like to learn more about
whcih times one should use different css display options like block, inline, inline-block v flex.
